# Dutch het words

This repository contains a list of Dutch "het" words which I encountered over
time. I tried to remove composites (which always get the article of the last
partial noun), unless they are used frequently in daily Dutch (e.g.
"buitenland" or "ziekenhuis").

## Render HTML
The words can be rendered in HTML by running from within the html directory:
```
npm run build
